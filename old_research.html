                <h1>Virus Detection</h1>
                <p>We are currently working on a virus detection scheme, in close collaboration with Livermore National Laboratory, which will be both fast and inexpensive. The detection mechanism will be based on the idea that a virus particle, located inside of a nanopore, will increase the ionic resistance of the pore. If a constant voltage difference is applied across the pore membrane, this increase in resistance will cause a measurable decrease in current. This technique has already been shown to not only be rigorous but also sensitive to a single virus particle. The video below discusses this area of our research in more detail.</p>

                <h1>Ionic Liquids</h1>
                <p>An ionic liquid is a salt that is in liquid form at room temperature. Because it is in liquid form, it can be thought of as a solution that is composed entirely of ions (unlike a typical electrolyte which is a solution with salt ions dissolved into it). Ionic fluids have beneficial properties that make them extremely promising. They are non corrosive, non flammable, and they have very low vapor pressure.</p>
                <p>Our aim is to use nanopores to probe electric properties of ionic liquids such as conductivity, ability to screen electric charge, and stability. Ionic liquids are seen by many labs around the world to have promise in the world of battery technology; Several projects in our lab are geared toward realizing this.</p>
                <p>Preliminary results show that ILs have remarkable charge screening compared to typical salts. This is suspected to be due to the comparative size of the IL ions to our nanopores. Theoretical modeling is currently underway to describe this phenomenon in detail.</p>
